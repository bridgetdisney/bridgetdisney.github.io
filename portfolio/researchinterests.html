  <h2>Research Interests</h2>
  <div class="researchdiv">
    <p class="indent">
      Data science education for librarians, data curation
      (including metadata and dataset discovery), research assistance services,
      data visualization, text analysis, data mining, and digital humanities.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      Research Philosophy: I approach research from a pragmatic world view,
      considering what works for collecting data and understanding the problem.
    </p>

  <h3 class="indentresearch">Dissertation Topic: Data Science Education for
    Librarians and Information Scientists</h3>
  <div class="researchdiv">
  <h4 class="indent">Research Questions</h4>
  <p class="indent">
    <strong>RQ1:</strong> What are the data science skills most needed by
    librarians and information scientists, particularly in a research setting?
    (Consider specific skills above and beyond the core competencies of
    librarianship)
  </p><p class="indent">
  <strong>RQ2:</strong> What components of the data science profession are
    useful to careers in library and information science?
  </p><p class="indent">
    <strong>RQ3:</strong> Which LIS/iSchool courses  teach data science skills?
    (regular courses and special topic courses)
  </p><p class="indent">
    <strong>RQ4:</strong> How do the data related courses meet the need for data
    science skills garnered from RQ1? Are there gaps in the data science
    training needed for library and information schools?
  </p><p>
    <h4 class="indent">Auxillary Questions</h4>
  </p><p class="indent">
    What is the difference or advantage of being an iSchool or ALA accredited
    LIS school? (Analysis of data science opportunities in both.)
  </p><p class="indent">
    How can information scientists and librarians increase their data science
    skills outside of coursework (DataCamp, Carpentries, etc)?
  </p><p class="indent">
    Should the data science emphasis for librarians be data curation or data
    analysis?
  </p><p class="indent">
    Which LIS/iSchool courses encourage participation in future development of
    data science opportunities? (looking into the future for ideas that are not yet being implemented)
  </p><p class="indent">
    What certificate programs are being offered in library and information
    science schools?
  </p><p class="indent">
    Would it be feasible for library and information science programs to offer a
    certificate in data science for research in all fields? The library and
    information field offers significant advantages for understanding the
    development of research. The data science skills would not need to reach the
    computer science level of topics such as programming machine learning, but
    instead would be geared toward those that would like to do deeper research.
