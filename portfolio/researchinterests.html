  <h2>Research Interests</h2>
  <div id="researchdiv">
  <p class="indent">
    Data science education for librarians, data curation
    (including metadata and dataset discovery), research assistance services, data visualization,
    text analysis, data mining, and digital humanities.
  </p>
  </div>
  <h2>Possible Roadmap for Future Research</h2>
  <div id="researchdiv">
  <h4 class="futureresearchheading">Data science education for librarians:</h4>
  <p class="indentresearch">
    Several students within the School of Information Science
    and Learning Technologies have
    expressed an interest in learning technical skills, namely data science. While there are
    pockets of data related courses offered within the school, fundamental data science courses
    offered in different departments are not available to SISLT students.
    <br>
    The research would require determining which data science skills would be most useful in
    librarires and matching those skills to library courses offered by ALA accredited library
    science programs. The research question would be: Are library schools meeting the need
    for data science education? How are outside organizations (e.g. Carpentries) contributing
    to data science knowledge of librarians?
  </p>
  <h4 class="futureresearchheading">Dataset Discovery and Reuse:</h4>
  <p class="indentresearch">
    This could be a case study of five papers, each representing different disciplines,
    where the author searched for and reused datasets. The specific challenges encountered
    using and integrating existing data would be covered as well as the advantages. The
    purpose would be to help research librarians understand how to bests serve patrons with
    research and data curation needs.
  </p>
  <h4 class="futureresearchheading">Research Assistance Services:</h4>
  <p class="indentresearch">
    More and more universities are providing specialiazed research assistance through their
    libraries. Two examples are The Scholar's Lab at the University of Virginia, and the
    Center for Digital Research for the Humanities (CDRH) at the University of Nebraska. What
    strategies have these centers employed and how do they help researchers?
  </p>
  <h4 class="futureresearchheading">Data Visualization:</h4>
  <p class="indentresearch">
    What tools are available for data visualization and what are their uses, strengths,
    and weaknesses?
  </p>
  <h4 class="futureresearchheading">Text Analysis and Data Mining:</h4>
  <p class="indentresearch">
    Comparing manual qualitative research pattern analysis to automated analysis using text
    analysis and data mining techniques.

<!--
  Definition of data science and other technology skills.

Are these skills needed in the library setting? Academic? Public? Special libraries?
	-interviewing librarians
	-surveys
	-literature review of data use in libraries

How are ALA accredited library schools meeting this need?
	-assessing the catalog of courses for all these schools
	-comparing it to the needs from the first question

How are organizations outside of library schools meeting this need?
	-Carpentry

In particular, how can academic research librarians use their skills to help researchers?
	-dataset discovery
