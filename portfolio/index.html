    <p class="indenthome">I am a PhD student at the University of Missouri&apos;s School of Information
      Science and Educational Technology. I hold a Master of Arts degree in
      Library and Information Science from the University of Missouri plus a BS/BA
      in Computer Science and French from the University of Nebraska. Past  endeavors have
      included working on the
      Digital Humanities Commons website at the University of Missouri
      and an internship at the Center for Digital Research
      in the Humanities at the University of Nebraska.
    </p>
    <p class="indenthome">I have also been an instructor of
      a technology class for educators (ISLT 4467: Inquiry into Empowering Learners with Technology) offered
      in the College of Education. Before returning to school for my
      library science degree, I worked as a software engineer at Northrop Grumman Corporation for 14 years.
    </p>
    <p class="indenthome">My research interests stem from the belief that the field of library and information
      science has a lot to contribute to the application of data science in the academic and
      real world. These areas include data science education for librarians, data curation
      (including metadata and datasetdiscovery), research assistance services, data visualization,
      text analysis, data mining, and digital humanities.
