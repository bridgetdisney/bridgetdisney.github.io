          Librarians and Information Scientists</h3>
        <h4>Research Questions</h4>
        <p class="indentresearch">
          <strong>RQ1:</strong> What are the data science skills most needed by
          librarians and information scientists, particularly in a research setting?
          (Consider specific skills above and beyond the core competencies of
          librarianship)
        </p><p class="indentresearch">
        <strong>RQ2:</strong> What components of the data science profession are
          useful to careers in library and information science?
        </p><p class="indentresearch">
          <strong>RQ3:</strong> Which LIS/iSchool courses  teach data science skills?
          (regular courses and special topic courses)
        </p><p class="indentresearch">
          <strong>RQ4:</strong> How do the data related courses meet the need for data
          science skills garnered from RQ1? Are there gaps in the data science
          training needed for library and information schools?
        </p>
        <h4>Hypotheses</h4>
        <p class="indentresearch">
          <strong>H1:</strong> There are gaps in data science education for librarians
          that can be identified and improved upon.
        </p><p class="indentresearch">
          <strong>H2:</strong> There exist a set of data science skills and competencies
          that apply specifically to library and research settings.
        </p>
        <h4>Auxillary Questions</h4>
        </p><p class="indentresearch">
          What is the difference or advantage of being an iSchool or ALA accredited
          LIS school? (Analysis of data science opportunities in both.)
        </p><p class="indentresearch">
          How can information scientists and librarians increase their data science
          skills outside of coursework (DataCamp, Carpentries, etc)?
        </p><p class="indentresearch">
          Should the data science emphasis for librarians be data curation or data
          analysis?
        </p><p class="indentresearch">
          Which LIS/iSchool courses encourage participation in future development of
          data science opportunities? (looking into the future for ideas that are not yet being implemented)
        </p><p class="indentresearch">
          What certificate programs are being offered in library and information
          science schools?
        </p><p class="indentresearch">
          Would it be feasible for library and information science programs to offer a
          certificate in data science for research in all fields? The library and
          information field offers significant advantages for understanding the
          development of research. The data science skills would not need to reach the
          computer science level of topics such as programming machine learning, but
          instead would be geared toward those that would like to do deeper research.

            <td>Librarians who do data-related work were surveyed about their work and educational backgrounds and asked to rate the relevance of a set of data-related skills and knowledge to their work. Quantitative analysis was conducted using a variety of packages in R and RStudio, and visualizations were created using the ggplot2 package. Open-ended responses were analyzed manually. Also, cluster analysis.</td>
            <td>This article attempts to determine the role of data librarians in the context of research data services. The author reports on a survey distributed through (mostly medical) associations and twitter hashtag groups. A taxonomy of skills was rated by the respondents using a Likert scale, and qualitative comments were noted. Additionally, using cluster analysis, the author was able to divide the respondents into two groups, one being a data generalist and the other being a subject specialist. These analyses are able to provide an overall picture of the implications of the study, and the suggestion that "new curricula may be needed to enable data librarians to adequately respond to the evolving needs of research communities.”</td>

It is a self describes “qualitative content survey” that relies on website information as well as emails sent to class instructors. The results were basically descriptive with few new revelations found. However, it will be interesting to see how data related subjects in library schools have progressed in the last ten years. The authors state that no two data curation courses are alike, so perhaps there has been some improvement in defining this field with cohesive objectives.</td>

The extracted data from these last two lists were joined to make matches between them which resulted in over 6 million matched items. From there, they removed the duplicated to determine how the certificate courses were meeting the needs of each EDISON category.</td>

One theme that stands out is how data librarians fit into the overall academic library structure, and also that the term “data librarian” is actually a broad term that could cover metadata, research services, geospatial, or other focused area. They came to the vague conclusion that the role needs to be more defined and that the necessary skills should be included in the LIS curriculum.</td>

            <td>Examining course titles and descriptions of ALA accredited LIS programs through text analysis, the author considers the gap between the data education and the skills needed by data professionals. It is useful that she grouped the academic program content accordingly: data curation, digital curation, digital humanities, data science, knowledge management, and informatics. Common phrases within the course content were analyzed for frequency and co-occurences using Gelphi. This was instrumental in showing the relationship between the terms. In conclusion, she suggests a more conclusive definition of “data professional,” and a continuation of interdisciplinary programs, which are evident in ALA programs that are iSchools.</td>

One can see how these skills could be matched to specific competencies mastered in the LIS curriculum.

It aptly points out that data science is of a positivist nature in that data is concrete, but that information science analyzes the bias in the data stemming from the fact that statistical samples, while representative, are actually all different.
